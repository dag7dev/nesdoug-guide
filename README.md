# How to Program an NES game in C - Premise

## What is this guide?

Before starting I should say a couple of things:

{% hint style="danger" %}
This is **not** my guide. I have **not** written this.  
All rights reserved to: [nesdoug](https://github.com/nesdoug) and his [personal blog](https://nesdoug.com/2018/09/05/introduction/) !
{% endhint %}

I merely have copied everything and put into gitbook **for my and your convenience**.  


I do **not** mantain resources or anything else other than this guide. I won't alter or modify any content of the original blog other than adjust the style of some elements

If you have any doubts concerning about code, syntax or content please contact the original author!

## Who are you?

I am dag7, a programmer interested in many things including programming on old consoles.

I found nesdoug tutorials excellent and I found gitbook perfect to adapt it.

{% hint style="warning" %}
 Starting from now, me and the author are not responsible for bricked nes systems, dead everdrives, thermonuclear war, or you getting fired because the hello world app failed \(like it did for us...\).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**YOU** are choosing to install everything and follow this guide, and if you point the finger at any of us for messing up your devices, we will laugh at you.
{% endhint %}

## Have fun! And don't forget to thanks me and the original author!

p.s. one more thing: you will find an "about me" part. It is not me, it's about the author.  
Just in case! üôå‚Äç‚Äç
